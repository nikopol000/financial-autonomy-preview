# Financial Autonomy — Implementation Queue

Last updated: 2026-10-10

## Status vocabulary
- READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION — explicitly approved and not started.
- IN PROGRESS — work has started; include exact next unchecked step.
- READY FOR USER TEST — implemented and active in preview, awaiting user confirmation.
- DONE — user-confirmed or otherwise explicitly accepted.
- BLOCKED — cannot continue without a named dependency.

## Current item — Dashboard design polish v017.67
Status: READY FOR USER TEST

Requirement:
- Independent expansion and card heights for Cheltuit and Următorul venit.
- Consistent surrounding borders and better theme contrast.
- Clearer Budget card separation, compact primary-first view, extra pinned windows behind a toggle.
- Preserve financial calculations and browser-local data.

Evidence:
- v017.66 already contained independent `useState` expansion and hidden-by-default supplemental budget windows.
- v017.67 surgical visual refinement bundle commit `72d958a17485051f29a24e79a6bcf25b71d215cf`.
- Activated through preview commit `0fd5b4fe7d35dc32c02e673b96aa8739d29d4bff`, Vercel check success.
- Bundle syntax verified, user interaction not yet confirmed.

Exact next step:
1. User tests v017.67 at https://financial-autonomy-preview.vercel.app/ on phone.
2. Collect specific UI defects if observed.
3. Reconcile private source repository (behind web preview) before any full rebuild; preserve active version and avoid regression.
4. After user approval, mark DONE and continue next READY item.

## Previous item — Debt / credit balance updates

### Debt / credit balance updates
Status: READY FOR USER TEST

Requirement:
All Finance entities that have a balance which can change over time must allow the user to update that balance later. This includes debt/credit products. Credit Card was the reported missing case.

Evidence in preview repository:
- c0bcd3ff745447a9cde0b1cd38b5dff6f00216a2 — preview: publish debt balance updates
- c76a9ac1b743bac877c7eb25814677dfc1b7e70a — preview: activate debt balance updates

Next step:
- User tests the active preview, especially Credit Card and the other Finance balance-bearing types.
- If a type still lacks `Actualizează soldul`, fix that type and update this queue/checkpoint in the same cycle.

## Recently completed
- Donations and Subscriptions expense types: published and activated 2026-10-05.
- Backup password confirmation/show-hide: published and activated 2026-10-05.
- Selectable budgets for daily budget/safe pace: published and activated 2026-10-04.

## Queue discipline
Do not implement an item merely because it is mentioned in historical chat. Only implement items marked READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION or continue the exact unchecked step of an IN PROGRESS item.
After publishing/activating a change, immediately update PROJECT_STATE.md and this file before declaring the iteration complete.
